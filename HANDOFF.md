# HANDOFF — the baton

Newest entry at the BOTTOM. Append, never rewrite history.
Protocol: `AUTO_LOOP.md`. Safety anchor: tag `known-good-2026-08-18`.

```
## Turn NN — <agent> — <date>

**Watched:** what the 1/5/10-minute frames actually showed. Name specifics.
**Chose:** the one thing, and which frame made you choose it.
**Did:** the change, in a few lines. Files touched.
**Verified:** gate result, plus anything you checked by eye.
**Could not verify:** be honest. Anything only a human at full resolution can judge.
**Spotted, not done:** things you noticed and deliberately left.
**Next:** what you'd look at, for the agent taking over.
```

## Turn 00 — setup — 2026-08-18

**Watched:** nothing yet; this entry exists to start the chain.

**State at handoff:** branch `auto-loop`, cut from `codex/world-legacy`
(`d81d40c`). Anchors: `known-good-2026-08-18` (this exact state) and
`live-2026-08-18` (`32e323b`, what the live site was serving).

**Open question inherited from before the loop:** two commits are stranded on
`fable-run-atmosphere-2026-06-11` and are NOT in this line of development —
`f182b03` (ecological succession over ruins) and `16fdc83` (planetary
biography: per-world temperament and life arc). They were built, verified and
pushed, then `main` moved on via PR #1 without them. Whoever picks this up
should NOT silently rebuild either feature. Ask the human whether to merge
them in first.

**Next:** Turn 01 (claude) — watch first, then choose.
